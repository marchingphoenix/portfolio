# CS 210 Journal
For this Journal I selected Project 3 - Corner Store History

## Project Summary
Project 3 simulated a simple purchase history output from the Corner Grocer customer where they would output a list of items throughout the day and the would like an application to tally the sales and output the counts in multiple ways.
The program needed to take in the raw input, tabulate the results in an output file and then prompt the user to choose from one of 3 output options.  
1. Input an item and give the count for that single item.
2. Output all items and their counts.
3. Output all items as a histogram.

## What did i do well?
I'm proud of how I designed the 2 classes to minimize the code in Main and the reduction in duplicate code.

## How could I improve?
Could potentially use other console output libraries to simplify some of the formatting code.

## What was the most challenging part?
I had trouble with the menu looping due to an over-complicated initial approach. After simplifying the menu, the `switch` statement inside a while loop worked well.

## What skills are transferable?
This was a good example of Object Oriented Programming. Those skills can apply to almost every language and most situations.

## How did I make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Followed best practices for C++ by using descriptive variable, class, and function names as well as extensive comments.
The classes do not have hard coded file names so they could easily be swapped out.
